I also remembered that the United States Postal Service issued a Presley stamp about 15 years ago.<br /><br />This piqued my curiosity, so I decided to delve deeper and see what other music artists and bands might be featured on stamps. I went to the music category on the Cool Stamps website and painstakingly noted which ones featured pop, rock, jazz, blues and country acts, and where they came from.<br /><br />It wasn&#39;t a major surprise to find out that Presley ended up on top of the list, with 299 stamps from more than 30 places, and that The Beatles followed with 245 from more than a dozen locations.<br /><br />But who&#39;d have thought that Mongolia was a hot bed for Dead heads? The large but low-profile country located between Russia and China has issued 10 Grateful Dead stamps and a remarkable 27 featuring its late leader, Jerry Garcia.<br /><p>I thought Michael Jackson would have more than 22 stamps, but I&#39;m sure more will soon start flooding the market after his death earlier this year. Maybe the same logic can be applied to Paul McCartney&#39;s lack of popularity, as he now has just one stamp solely dedicated to him as opposed to 75 for his deceased Beatles bandmate, John Lennon.</p><p>And why does Sting get 50 stamps when The Police, as an entire band, are shut out?</p>There was a preference of style over substance, as Britney Spears was featured on 68 stamps compared to Bob Dylan&#39;s two and Paul Robeson and Bruce Springsteen&#39;s one.<br /><br />Brutal violence has been part of daily life in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for far too long, so perhaps there was some sort of subliminal &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; message of love underlying the country&#39;s release of nine Sonny &amp; Cher stamps.<br /><br />There&#39;s a small amount of Canadian content on the list, with Celine Dion represented on 17 stamps, followed by Sum 41 on six, Shania Twain on two, and Nelly Furtado, Alanis Morissett, Anne Murray and Hank Snow on one each.<br /><br />I remembered my time spent during childhood as a philatelist (get your mind out of the gutter, I collected stamps) that many tiny or poor countries produced and exported unlikely stamps to try and boost their gross domestic product. That apparently hasn&#39;t changed.&#0160; <br /><br />I hadn&#39;t heard of some of the places putting out stamps, and I&#39;m pretty good with geography (and even won $1,000 on the &quot;You Bet Your Ass&quot; television game show using that knowledge), but some quick research revealed that many of them were republics within the Russian Federation.<br /><p>I couldn&#39;t make out the place of origin or locate a region that corresponded with the name on some of the stamps, and couldn&#39;t figure out those that didn&#39;t use the English alphabet, so I put them in the &quot;Unsure&quot; category when it came to designating where they came from. </p><p>Don&#39;t consider the following list to include everything that&#39;s available, but it will give you a good idea of the surprising breadth of music stamps in the marketplace for collectors. It can also act as an unofficial popularity chart for the artists.</p>Here&#39;s the postage stamp hit parade:<br /><br /><strong>Elvis Presley 299</strong><br />Tadjikistan 25<br />Gambia 23<br />Liberia 21<br />Grenada 20<br />Kyrgizstan 19<br />Micronesia 14<br />St. Vincent 14<br />Dominica 13<br />Udmurtia 12<br />Mali 10<br />Sao Tome and Principe 10<br />Antigua 9<br />Democratic Republic of the Congo 10<br />Guyana 9<br />Mongolia 9<br />Senegal 9<br />Sierra Leone 8<br />Mongolia 7<br />St. Kitts-Nevis 6<br />Palau 4<br />Tanzania 4<br />Nevis 3<br />Burkina Faso 2<br />Bequia 1<br />Kalmykia 1<br />Maldive Islands 1<br />Montserrat 1<br />Turkmenistan 1<br />Tuvalu 1<br />United Nations 1<br />Unsure 22<br /><br /><strong>The Beatles 245</strong><br />Karelia 57<br />Tatarstan 53<br />Sakhalin 24<br />Udmurtia 24<br />Tadjikistan 18<br />Chad 12<br />Kyrgyzstan 10<br />Tanzania 9<br />Turkmenistan 9<br />Ivory Coast 6<br />United Kingdom 4<br />Unsure 19<br /><br /><strong>The Rolling Stones 89</strong><br />Buriatia 24<br />Mordovia 24<br />Udmurtia 12<br />Tadjikistan 9<br />Austria 4<br />Gambia 2<br />St. Vincent 1<br />Tanzania 1<br />Unsure 12<br /><br /><strong>Backstreet Boys 76</strong><br />Buriatia 18<br />Karelia 12<br />Kyrgyzstan 10<br />Chechnya 9<br />Gagauzia 9<br />Turkmenistan 1<br />Unsure 17<br /><br /><strong>John Lennon 75</strong><br />Antigua 14<br />Chad 9<br />Kyrgyzstan 9<br />St. Vincent 9<br />Turkmenistan 9<br />Gibraltar 5<br />Tuva 2<br />Abkhazia 1<br />Azerbaijan 1<br />Democratic Republic of the Congo 1<br />Guyana 1<br />Nicaragua 1<br />Ghana 1<br />Mali 1<br />Palau 1<br />Tanzania 1<br />Unsure 9<br /><br /><strong>Jerry Garcia 70</strong><br />Mongolia 27<br />Montserrat 25<br />Niger 9<br />Togo 9<br /><br /><strong>Britney Spears 68</strong><br />Ingushetia 12<br />Karelia 12<br />Kalmykia 10<br />Sakha Republic 9<br />Tadjikistan 9<br />Kyrgyzstan 7<br />Unsure 9<br /><br /><strong>Queen 64</strong><br />Tadjikistan 18<br />Bashkortostan 12<br />Mordovia 9<br />Turkmenistan 9<br />Tuva 3<br />Democratic Republic of the Congo 1<br />Unsure 12<br /><br /><strong>Madonna 52</strong><br />Kyrgyzstan 19<br />Bashkortostan 13<br />Gambia 9<br />Democratic Republic of the Congo 2<br />Komi Republic 2<br />Tadjikistan 2<br />Kalmykia 1<br />Khakassia 1<br />St. Vincent 1<br />Unsure 2<br /><strong><br />Sting 50</strong><br />Buriatia 12<br />Sakha Republic 12<br />Mordovia 1<br />Palau 1<br />Unsure 24<br /><br /><strong>Bob Marley 49</strong><br />Mordovia 12<br />Dagestan 9<br />Turkmenistan 9<br />Montserrat 8<br />Jamaica 7<br />Mongolia 2<br />Chad 1<br />Tanzania 1<br /><br /><strong>Spice Girls 47</strong><br />Jewish Republic 7<br />Dagestan 6<br />Gagauzia 6<br />Nakhchivan 6<br />Adjara 5<br />Kamchatka 4<br />Tadjikistan 1<br />Unsure 12<br /><br /><strong>Led Zeppelin 41</strong><br />Kalmykia 22<br />Turkmenistan 9<br />Tatarstan 7<br />Tuva 3<br /><br /><strong>Frank Sinatra 40</strong><br />Karelia 24<br />Buriatia 4<br />Equatorial Guinea 2<br />Grenada 2<br />Mali 2<br />Scotland 2<br />Democratic Republic of the Congo 1<br />Guyana 1<br />Kyggyzstan 1<br />St. Vincent 1<br /><br /><strong>Jimi Hendrix 38</strong><br />Dagestan 12<br />Udmurtia 12<br />Gambia 1<br />Grenada 1<br />Liberia 1<br />Montserrat 1<br />Tanzania 1<br />Unsure 9<br /><br /><strong>KISS 36</strong><br />Mordovia 16<br />Karelia 9<br />Dagestan 8<br />Tuva 3<br /><br /><strong>Tupac Shakur 28</strong><br />Mordovia 13<br />Tadjikistan 9<br />Komi Republic 3<br />Tatarstan 2<br />Turkmenistan 1<br /><br /><strong>Ricky Martin 27</strong><br />Komi Republic 9<br />Kyrgyzstan 2<br />Unsure 16<br /><br /><strong>NSYNC 27</strong><br />Buriatia 12<br />St. Vincent 1<br />Tadjikistan 1<br />Unsure 13<br /><br /><strong>Bee Gees 26</strong><br />Dagestan 12<br />Isle Of Man 10<br />Somalia 4<br /><br /><strong>Louis Armstrong 24</strong><br />Mordovia 16<br />Gambia 3<br />Ghana 1<br />Grenada 1<br />Guyana 1<br />St. Vincent 1<br />Tanzania 1<br /><br /><strong>Jennifer Lopez 24</strong><br />Tadjikistan 10<br />Kyrgyzstan 2<br />Democratic Republic of the Congo 1<br />Unsure 11<br /><br /><strong>AC/DC 22</strong><br />Tadjikistan 10<br />Dagestan 9<br />Tuva 3<br /><br /><strong>Michael Jackson 22</strong><br />St. Vincent 9<br />Guinea-Bissau 1<br />Jewish Republic 1<br />Kyrgyzstan 1<br />Tanzania 1<br />Unsure 9<br /><br /><strong>Elton John 18</strong><br />Udmurtia 6<br />Malta 4<br />Buriatia 3<br />Australia 2<br />Gibraltar 1<br />Komi Republic 1<br />Tanzania 1<br /><br /><strong>Celine Dion 17</strong><br />Mordovia 9<br />Kyrgyzstan 1<br />Unsure 7<br /><br /><strong>Guns N&#39;

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6b16d3c970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newpeter-gabriel-850-100" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a6b16d3c970c " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6b16d3c970c-800wi" title="Newpeter-gabriel-850-100" /></a> <br /> We&#39;re not sure when it will arrive yet, but Peter Gabriel&#39;s first studio album since 2002&#39;s &quot;Up&quot; will be titled &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; and feature his interpretations of other people&#39;s songs.<br /><br />The former Genesis frontman will be accompanied by an orchestra in covering 13 songs, apparently including David Bowie&#39;s &quot;Heroes,&quot; Arcade Fire&#39;s &quot;My Body Is A Cage,&quot; The Kinks&#39; &quot;Waterloo Sunset,&quot; Paul Simon&#39;s &quot;The Boy In The Bubble&quot; and Neil Young&#39;s &quot;Philadelphia.&quot; Some still unnamed major artists are also supposed to perform Gabriel songs on the album.<br /><br />The concept of single artists releasing albums of other people&#39;s material (as opposed to multi-artist covers records or tribute albums, where multiple artists perform the songs of one particular person or band) isn&#39;t a new one, but it seems to be gaining in popularity. These records can put product in the marketplace when songwriters are going through dry spells, they can be done for fun, they can honour influential artists or they can act as quick cash grabs.<br /><br />The most popular artist to release covers albums in recent years has been Rod Stewart, whose last six records have all fallen into this category through his four-part &quot;The Great American Songbook&quot; series, 2006&#39;s &quot;Still The Same... Great Rock Classics Of Our Time&quot; and the just-released &quot;Soulbook.&quot; The first five have all sold from 50,000 to more than 300,000 copies in Canada, and 10 times those numbers south of the border. It&#39;s too bad that a guy who was so talented and prolific in his younger days has come to this, since he adds little to the originals, but you can&#39;t argue with his success.<br /><br />The band perhaps most commonly associated with covers albums these days (since that&#39;s all it makes) is the punk rock supergroup Me First And The Gimme Gimmes, which formed in 1995 and features members of Foo Fighters, NOFX, Swingin&#39; Utters and Lagwagon doing punk-pop versions of popular songs from various genres. The band has released five studio albums, a live LP and last year&#39;s &quot;Have Another Ball,&quot; which features songs previously released on seven-inch singles and compilations. You can put almost any of these on at a party and I can pretty much guarantee that your guests will have a good time.<br /><br />Here are 23 other notable single artist albums comprised exclusively of covers that you might want to check out or, in some cases, maybe not:<br /><br /><strong>Tori Amos — &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot;</strong><br />This 2001 Grammy Award-nominated album features the female singer/songwriter interpreting songs originally recorded by men. Amos&#39; version of The Beatles&#39; &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot; includes samples of the father and son American presidents Bush, while the record also features her singing The Velvet Underground&#39;s &quot;New Age,&quot; 10cc&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m Not In Love,&quot; Neil Young&#39;s &quot;Heart Of Gold&quot; and The Boomtown Rats&#39; &quot;I Don&#39;t Like Mondays.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Paul Anka — &quot;Rock Swings&quot; </strong><br />This Ottawa-raised <a href="http://blogs.music.msn.ca/2009/10/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-paul-anka-has-done-better.html" target="_blank">singer/songwriter</a>&#39;s album came out in 2005 and featured swing jazz versions of &#39;80s and &#39;90s rock and pop hits, including R.E.M&#39;s &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; Van Halen&#39;s &quot;Jump,&quot; Nirvana&#39;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and The Cure&#39;s &quot;The Lovecats.&quot; It was certified gold in Canada.<br /><br /><strong>Jann Arden — &quot;Uncover Me&quot;</strong><br />Arden has become one of Canada&#39;s foremost songwriters over the past 15 years, but I&#39;ve always preferred talking to and joking with her than listening to her sensitive balladry. Therefore this 2007 10-song collection of covers — including Cat Stevens&#39; &quot;Peace Train,&quot; Dusty Springfield&#39;s &quot;Son Of A Preacher Man&quot; and Petula Clark&#39;s &quot;Downtown&quot; — is a pleasant alternative.&#0160; <br /><br /><strong>Pat Boone — &quot;In A Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;</strong><br />Much of Boone&#39;s success in the &#39;50s and early &#39;60s was derived from covering R&amp;B songs by black artists who couldn&#39;t make it on to the still segregationist playlists of most mainstream U.S. radio stations of that era. Zoom forward 35 years to this 1997 album and you have the conservative Christian activist doing jazz/big band versions of AC/DC&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock &#39;N&#39; Roll),&quot; Van Halen&#39;s &quot;Panama,&quot; Metallia&#39;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s &quot;Crazy Train&quot; (which was later used as the theme to the Black Sabbath singer&#39;s reality television series). Boone&#39;s old fans didn&#39;t like it and I&#39;m sure that true metal and hard rock fans hated it, but I appreciate its kitsch value and definitely prefer it to &quot;Rock Swings.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>David Bowie — &quot;Pin Ups&quot;</strong><br />This 1973 LP should perhaps be the standard against which all covers albums are measured, and I don&#39;t think that any others can match it. It topped the U.K. sales chart and Bowie&#39;s version of The Merseys&#39; &quot;Sorrow&quot; reached #3 on the singles chart over there. Covers of The Pretty Things&#39; &quot;Rosalyn,&quot; Them&#39;s &quot;Here Comes The Night,&quot; Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;See Emily Play,&quot; The Easybeats&#39; &quot;Friday On My Mind,&quot; The Yardbirds&#39; &quot;Shapes Of Things&quot; and others at least match and often surpass the original versions.<br /><br /><strong>Def Leppard — &quot;Yeah!&quot;</strong><br />&quot;No!&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Erasure — &quot;Other People&#39;s Songs&quot;</strong><br />This 2003 album from the synth-pop duo of Andy Bell and Vince Clarke featured songs that influenced them, and they showed their good and eclectic taste by including The Korgis&#39; &quot;Everybody&#39;s Got To Learn Sometime,&#39; Buddy Holly&#39;s &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;True Love Ways,&quot; and The Buggles&#39; &quot;Video Killed The Radio Star.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Everclear — &quot;The Vegas Years&quot;</strong><br />Van Morrison&#39;s &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was originally included on Everclear&#39;s 2000 LP, &quot;Songs From An American Movie, Vol. 1: Learning How To Smile.&quot; It almost dragged down the band&#39;s <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/75771/everclear-focus-on-second-third-albums" target="_blank">recent Toronto concert</a>, and a live version of it is included on this 2008 album. It&#39;s a hit-and-miss collection, with the hits being Yaz&#39;s &quot;Bad Connection,&quot; Neil Young&#39;s &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; Roy Acuff&#39;s &quot;Night Train To Memphis,&quot; Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders&#39; &quot;Kicks&quot; and a live rendition of Tommy Tutone&#39;s &quot;867-5309 (Jenny).&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Bryan Ferry — &quot;Dylanesque&quot;</strong><br />The Roxy Music frontman&#39;s 2007 album featured covers of Bob Dylan songs and, although it was a commercial failure in North America, it reached the top 10 in the U.K. and Sweden. I liked Ferry&#39;s version of Dylan&#39;s &quot;A Hard Rain&#39;s A-Gonna Fall&quot; from his 1973 solo debut and covers album, &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; (which also included covers of songs by The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and Smokey Robinson And The Miracles), but I didn&#39;t need to hear him do 11 Dylan cuts.<br /><br /><strong>Guns N&#39; Roses — &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;</strong><br />GNR&#39;s fifth album came out in 1993 and would be the band&#39;s last LP until last year&#39;s &quot;Chinese Democracy.&quot; Bassist Duff McKagan sang lead on covers of The Damned&#39;s &quot;New Rose,&quot; The Stooges&#39; &quot;Raw Power,&quot; The Misfits&#39; &quot;Attitude&quot; and Johnny Thunders&#39; &quot;You Can&#39;t Put Your Arms Around A Memory,&quot; while Axl Rose assumed his familiar position fronting on such songs as the New York Dolls&#39; &quot;Human Being&quot; and Nazareth&#39;s &quot;Hair Of The Dog.&quot; Charles Manson&#39;s &quot;Look At Your Game, Girl&quot; was included as a hidden bonus track at the end. I prefer these 13 tracks to anything on &quot;Chinese Democracy.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Hindu Love Gods — &quot;Hindu Love Gods&quot;</strong><br />Warren Zevon and R.E.M.&#39;s Peter Buck, Bill Berry and Mike Mills apparently recorded these 10 songs during a drunken late-night session while making Zevon&#39;s &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; album in 1987. It wasn&#39;t meant to be released, but we should be thankful that it came out in 1990 and allowed us to hear wonderful versions of the Georgia Satellites&#39; &quot;Battleship Chains&quot; and Prince&#39;s &quot;Raspberry Beret.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>John Lennon — &quot;Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll&quot;</strong><br />This 1975 follow-up to &quot;Mind Games&quot; features the former Beatle covering his favourite songs from the late &#39;50s and early &#39;60s. Some of them were recorded at A&amp;M Studios in Hollywood and produced by Phil Spector, who later absconded with the master tapes, which led to delays in the album&#39;s release. A cover of Ben E. King&#39;s &quot;Stand By Me&quot; was released as a single, and other highlights include Gene Vincent&#39;s &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula,&quot; Chuck Berry&#39;s &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; and Lee Dorsey&#39;s &quot;Ya Ya.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Annie Lennox — &quot;Medusa&quot;</strong><br />The Eurythmics singer&#39;s second solo album was released in 1995, entered the U.K. sales chart at #1, has sold more than two million copies in the U.S. and earned Lennox a best female pop vocal performance Grammy for her version of The Lover Speaks&#39; &quot;No More I Love You&#39;s.&quot; Lennox&#39;s covers of Procul Harum&#39;s &quot;A Whiter Shade Of Pale,&quot; Bob Marley&#39;s &quot;Waiting In Vain&quot; and Paul Simon&#39;s &quot;Something So Right&quot; were also released as singles and, like Amos&#39; &quot;Strange Little Girls,&quot; all of the songs on the record were originally performed by men.<br /><br /><strong>The Moog Cookbook — &quot;The Moog Cookbook&quot; and &quot;Ye Olde Space Band: Plays Classic Rock Hits&quot;</strong><br />Brian Kehew and Roger Joseph Manning Jr. (Jellyfish, Imperial Drag) released their self-titled album in 1996. It&#39;s made up entirely of instrumental versions of largely alternative rock songs recorded using only Moog and other analog synthesizers. It&#39;s more fun than that description and includes covers of Soundgarden&#39;s &quot;Black Hole Sun,&quot; Offspring&#39;s &quot;Come Out And Play&quot; and Neil Young&#39;s &quot;Rockin&#39; In The Free World.&quot; <br />The duo followed with 1997&#39;s &quot;Ye Olde Space Band: Plays Classic Rock Hits,&quot; which features Steppenwolf&#39;s &quot;Born To Be Wild,&quot; Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and KISS&#39; &quot;Rock &amp; Roll All Night.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>MxPx — &quot;On The Cover II&quot;</strong><br />The follow-up to 1995&#39;s 20-minute &quot;On The Cover&quot; — which included interpretations of Bryan Adams&#39; &quot;Summer Of &#39;69,&quot; Buddy Holly&#39;s &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; and The Blasters&#39; &quot;Marie Marie&quot; — came out early this year. This time the punk-pop band by-and-large successfully covers the likes of Dead Milkmen&#39;s &quot;Punk Rock Girl,&quot; Belinda Carlisle&#39;s &quot;Heaven Is A Place On Earth&quot; and Kim Wilde&#39;s &quot;Kids In America.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Willie Nelson — &quot;Stardust&quot;</strong><br />Nelson obviously wasn&#39;t too stoned to learn the words to 10 songs by other people for this 1978 album of pop standards. He did it so well that &quot;Georgia On My Mind,&quot; &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;All Of Me&quot; are now probably more closely associated with him than with the original composers and performers.<br /><br /><strong>Mike Ness — &quot;Under The Influences&quot;</strong><br />The Social Distortion frontman&#39;s second solo album came out in November 1999, just seven months after his &quot;Cheating At Solitaire&quot; debut. The first one featured mostly originals, and this one is all covers — and most of them are great. They include the Bobby Fuller Four&#39;s &quot;I Fought The Law,&quot; Marty Robbins&#39; &quot;Big Iron&quot; and Wanda Jackson&#39;s &quot;Funnel Of Love.&quot; Ness&#39; cover of Social D&#39;s &quot;Ball And Chain&quot; should perhaps technically eliminate &quot;Under The Influences&quot; from this list, but the album is too good to ignore.<br /><br /><strong>Ozzy Osbourne — &quot;Under Cover&quot;</strong><br />Osbourne was crazy enough to successfully pull of a cover of The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown&#39;s awesome &quot;Fire&quot; on this 2005 album, but the results weren&#39;t as good on The Beatles&#39; &quot;In My Life,&quot; Mott The Hoople&#39;s &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; or John Lennon&#39;s &quot;Woman&quot; and &quot;Working Class Hero.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Poison — &quot;Poison&#39;d&quot;</strong><br />I&#39;ll admit that &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; and &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot; are minor guilty pleasures for me (sort of like lead singer Bret Michaels&#39; reality television career, Pamela Anderson sex tape and cameos on the underrated &quot;The Chris Isaak Show&quot;). But, for the most part, I&#39;d rather hear this hair metal band cover Sweet&#39;s &quot;Little Willy,&quot; The Romantics&#39; &quot;What I Like About You&quot; and Grand Funk Railroad&#39;s &quot;We&#39;re An American Band&quot; than its original material. <br /><br /><strong>Patti Smith — &quot;Twelve&quot;</strong><br />After returning to music with four very solid albums following the 1994 death of husband and former MC5 guitarist Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, this 2007 Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame entrant went the cover route the same year with less success. &quot;Twelve&quot; includes interpretations of Tears For Fears&#39; &quot;Everybody Wants To Rule The World,&quot; The Rolling Stones&#39; &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; The Doors&#39; &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and Nirvana&#39;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>UB40 — &quot;Labour Of Love&quot; series</strong><br />UB40 was a talented and justifiably popular reggae group in the U.K. and hit #2 on the British sales charts with both its 1980 &quot;Signing Off&quot; debut album its &quot;Present Arms&quot; follow-up, but the band was pretty much unknown on this side of the Atlantic until 1983&#39;s &quot;Labour Of Love&quot; spawned a #1 hit with a reggae version of Neil Diamond&#39;s 1968 song &quot;Red Red Wine,&quot; which was inspired by Jamaican Tony Tribe&#39;s 1969 cover. <br />There was lots of other great stuff on &quot;Labour Of Love&quot; and its popularity demanded sequel records in 1989&#39;s &quot;Labour Of Love II&quot; (which had hits with Al Green&#39;s &quot;Here I Am [Come And Take Me]&quot; and The Temptations&#39; &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot;) and 1998&#39;s less successful &quot;Labour Of Love III.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Jennifer Warnes — &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot;</strong><br />Warnes toured as a backing singer for Leonard Cohen in the &#39;70s and this 1986 collection pays tribute to her Montreal-born mentor. It spans much of his career to that point and Warnes had a minor hit with her interpretation of &quot;First We Take Manhattan.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Dwight Yoakam — &quot;Under The Covers&quot; and &quot;Dwight Sings Buck&quot;</strong><br />This country artist scored hits early in his career with covers of Johnny Horton&#39;s &quot;Honky Tonk Man&quot; and Elvis Presley&#39;s &quot;Little Sister,&quot; while also recording Johnny Cash&#39;s &quot;Ring Of Fire&quot; and Harlan Howard&#39;s &quot;Heartaches By The Number,&quot; so this 1997 album consisting entirely of covers didn&#39;t come as too much of a surprise. He successfully moves away from country on some of them, too, including The Clash&#39;s &quot;Train In Vain,&quot; The Kinks&#39; &quot;Tired Of Waiting For You,&quot; The Rolling Stones&#39; &quot;The Last Time&quot; and The Beatles&#39; &quot;Things We Said Today.&quot; <br />Yoakam was very much influenced by Buck Owens and later became close friends with him, so he paid tribute to the honky-tonk artist a year after his 2006 death with &quot;Dwight Sings Buck.&quot; Favourites include &quot;Act Naturally,&quot; &quot;Crying Time&quot; and &quot;Close Up The Honky Tonks.&quot;<br /><br />What are your favourite and least favourite covers albums?<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

      <title>Rihanna and Chris Brown: Let's get back to their music</title>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6a90da0970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="NewRihanna" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a6a90da0970c " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6a90da0970c-800wi" title="NewRihanna" /></a> <br /> After the death of Michael Jackson, the biggest non-directly music-related story in the music world this year has probably been Chris Brown&#39;s assault of former girlfriend Rihanna.<br /><br />The two young R&amp;B singers had been a serious item until the night of the Grammy Awards on Feb. 8, when Brown attacked Rihanna in a car. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June and received five years probation.<br /><br />While the 21-year-old Barbadian (born Robyn Rihanna Fenty) has sold more than 12 million copies of her three albums and has racked up five #1 hits in the U.S., and the 20-year-old Brown&#39;s debut single topped the American singles chart in 2005 and he&#39;s sold millions of copies of his two albums, the publicity generated from the incident was greater than the two had ever received before.<br /><br />But now that Brown isn&#39;t allowed within 100 yards of Rihanna (except for public events, where the distance is reduced to 10 yards) and the violence is hopefully all in the past, it&#39;s time once again to focus on the artists&#39; music. <br /><br />Okay, Rihanna will talk about the assault on ABC&#39;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot; later this week. She also opened up about it in the December issue of &quot;Glamour Magazine,&quot; which comes out on Nov. 10. After that, fingers crossed, we can turn our attention back to what this woman was previously known best for.<br /><br />Rihanna has just revealed the track list for her new album, &quot;Rated R,&quot; which will be released on Nov. 23. Songs with titles like &quot;Stupid In Love,&quot; &quot;Rude Boy,&quot; &quot;Photographs&quot; and &quot;Cold Case Love&quot; could possibly be related to the failed romance and its aftermath, but we&#39;ll have to wait until the album arrives to find out for sure.<br /><br />But &quot;Wait Your Turn&quot; has leaked on to the Internet, and it&#39;s a somewhat sparse electronic number that features Rihanna singing &quot;The wait is over&quot; a number of times. While the wait for the follow-up to 2007&#39;s &quot;Good Girl Gone Bad&quot; album has been building, this track doesn&#39;t really go anywhere and is pretty disappointing. <br /><br />The first single from &quot;Rated R,&quot; the Ne-Yo-written and produced &quot;Russian Roulette,&quot; is also available for public consumption. It features a somewhat metallic guitar introduction, a relatively slow tempo and awkward lyrics about shooting yourself. It ends with the sound of a gun shot. The best thing about the single is its striking cover, which features a topless Rihanna wearing a corset while wrapped in barbed wire.<br /><br />Young Jeezy raps during the bridge on &quot;Hard,&quot; and it&#39;s a little more up-tempo, with Rihanna repeating &quot;Yeah&quot; and &quot;so hard&quot; and incorporating some island vibes into her delivery. It&#39;s the best of the three songs that are out there, but it&#39;s still no &quot;Umbrella.&quot;<br /><br />Black Eyed Peas member Will.i.am guests on &quot;Photographs&quot; and, surprisingly, former Guns N&#39; Roses guitarist Slash contributes to &quot;ROCKSTAR 101.&quot; Hopefully their tracks will be more fulfilling than what we&#39;ve heard so far.<br /><br />Brown will release his third album, &quot;Graffiti,&quot; on Dec. 15. The cover has just been revealed and it features the artist as some sort of black-clad space leprechaun who&#39;s holding a guitar, wearing sunglasses and aiming a can of spray-paint at colourful animated aliens. I have no idea if all of this is supposed to mean anything, but it sure looks silly.<br /><br />The first single, &quot;I Can Transform Ya,&quot; has been out for about a month. It features Swizz Beatz and rapping by another <a href="http://blogs.music.msn.ca/2009/10/lil-wayne-isnt-only-artist-to-play-with-guns.html" target="_blank">popular felon</a>, Lil Wayne, auto-tuned vocals, spare percussion and lyrics related to &quot;Transformers.&quot; It should have some dance floor appeal, but it would have had more of an impact if it came out earlier and was connected to &quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&quot; hitting movie theatres in June. Like Rihanna&#39;s new material, it&#39;s a change of pace and not what most people probably expected.<br /><br />Brown&#39;s forthcoming second single is an uplifting ballad titled &quot;Crawl&quot; that should appeal more to what remains of his previous fan base. Still photos from the video shoot for the song show Brown with R&amp;B singer/model Cassie, whose second album is expected next year.<br /><br />Rihanna&#39;s successful track record, increased fame and public sympathy for her pretty much assure that &quot;Rated R&quot; will debut at #1 on the sales chart. Brown also has those first two factors in his favour, but he&#39;s now a thug in many people&#39;s eyes. Will &quot;Graffiti&quot; top the chart, too?<br /><br />If it does, the old adage that &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot; will hold true. If not, Brown could find himself on the road to being a has-been just a year out of his teens. And it would serve him right.<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6450c9c970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="New-michael-j#422969" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a6450c9c970b " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6450c9c970b-800wi" title="New-michael-j#422969" /></a> <br /> Michael Jackson has been more popular since his death in June than he was at any point during his life since the mania which followed the 1982 release of &quot;Thriller.&quot;<br /><br />Jackson&#39;s album catalogue has been selling briskly and the soundtrack to the new &quot;Michael Jackson&#39;s This Is It&quot; film, which documents the rehearsals for 50 shows he was scheduled to play in London, England before his passing, will likely debut at the top of the sales chart. The movie has been receiving generally positive reviews and its opening day box office receipts totaled $7.4 million in the U.S. and $12.7 million in other countries.<br /><br />&quot;Michael Jackson&#39;s This Is It&quot; is expected to surpass &quot;U2: Rattle And Hum,&quot; &quot;Madonna: Truth Or Dare,&quot; &quot;Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience&quot; and the concert movie that had the biggest opening weekend ever, &quot;Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best Of Both Worlds Concert,&quot; in terms of earnings. It&#39;s only scheduled for a two-week theatrical run before it&#39;s released on DVD next year, but its popularity could possibly extend that.<br /><br />I have genuine respect for Jackson&#39;s talents as a singer and dancer, but generally prefer his music from his childhood days with his brothers in The Jackson 5 than most of his solo work, so I highly doubt that I&#39;ll attend a screening of &quot;Michael Jackson&#39;s This Is It.&quot;<br /><br />But it got me thinking about other music movies I&#39;ve seen in the past. Here are six of my favourite concert films (that revolve primarily around performances, as opposed to documentaries that rely more on interviews) that premiered in theatres and didn&#39;t go straight to video or DVD:<br /><br />&quot;Woodstock&quot; was a 1970 documentary about the legendary August 1969 concert in upstate New York. The most memorable performances from the three-hour film came from Canned Heat with &quot;Going Up The Country,&quot; The Who with &quot;We&#39;re Not Gonna Take It/See Me, Feel Me&quot; and &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash with &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,&quot; Country Joe McDonald with &quot;FISH Cheer/Feel-Like-I&#39;m-Fixing-to-Die-Rag&quot; and Jimi Hendrix with &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze.&quot; But in many respects, Woodstock was more about the event than the music. &quot;Don&#39;t take the brown acid.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; was shot at three July 1973 Led Zeppelin concerts at New York City&#39;s Madison Square Garden, and the 18-month overdue film premiered in October 1976. It also included footage of the band arriving in Pittsburgh in its private Boeing 720B jet, The Starship, and group manager Peter Grant having it out with a concert promoter in Baltimore. Additional performance footage was shot at England&#39;s Shepperton Studios in August 1974. Singer Robert Plant was amazing and his bandmates were brilliant, but the fantasy scenes in the film weirded me out — and I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t totally because of all the hashish and marijuana smoke that passed my way before and during the film&#39;s late night theatre showing I attended as a teenager.<br /><br />&quot;The Last Waltz&quot; documented the final concert of The Band&#39;s classic lineup on Nov. 25, 1976 at San Francisco&#39;s Winterland Ballroom, where the group was joined by the likes of Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Ronnie Hawkins, Dr. John, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters and Neil Young. The 1978 Martin Scorsese-directed film featured live performance footage, studio segments and interviews with The Band members. In addition to The Band&#39;s performances, guest highlights included Hawkins&#39; &quot;Who Do You Love?,&quot; Dr. John&#39;s &quot;Such A Night,&quot; Young&#39;s &quot;Helpless,&quot; Waters&#39; &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; and an all-hands-on-deck rendition of Dylan&#39;s &quot;I Shall Be Released.&quot;&#0160; <br /><br />The &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot; soundtrack introduced me to a number of bands I&#39;ve since made part of my album collection. The 1982 film features performances shot at various locations in 1980, with the most impressive being Wall Of Voodoo&#39;s &quot;Back In Flesh,&quot; Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark&#39;s &quot;Enola Gay,&quot; Oingo Boingo&#39;s &quot;Ain&#39;t This The Life,&quot; Echo &amp; The Bunnymen&#39;s &quot;The Puppet,&quot; XTC&#39;s &quot;Respectable Street,&quot; Klaus Nomi&#39;s &quot;Total Eclipse,&quot; The Go-Go&#39;s&#39; &quot;We Got The Beat,&quot; Steel Pulse&#39;s &quot;Ku Klux Klan,&quot; Gary Numan&#39;s &quot;Down In The Park,&quot; Joan Jett And The Blackhearts&#39; &quot;Bad Reputation,&quot; The Members&#39; &quot;Offshore Banking Business,&quot; Au Pairs&#39; &quot;Come&#0160; Again,&quot; The Cramps&#39; &quot;Tear It Up,&quot; Pere Ubu&#39;s &quot;Birdies,&quot; Devo&#39;s &quot;Uncontrollable Urge,&quot; John Otway&#39;s &quot;Cheryl&#39;s Going Home,&quot; Gang Of Four&#39;s &quot;He&#39;d Send In The Army,&quot; 999&#39;s &quot;Homicide&quot; and The Fleshtones&#39; &quot;Shadowline.&quot; You won&#39;t find a better collection of new wave material assembled in one film.<br /><br />Talking Heads are one of my favourite bands, but I never saw the New York City group live, so 1984&#39;s Jonathan Demme-directed &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; is probably as close as I&#39;ll ever get. The film was shot over three nights at Hollywood&#39;s Pantages Theatre in December 1983 as part of the group&#39;s tour in support of &quot;Speaking In Tongues.&quot; The first film made entirely using digital audio techniques opens with David Byrne walking on stage with a portable cassette player and an acoustic guitar to play &quot;Psycho Killer.&quot; He&#39;s joined by other group members and guest musicians as the film progresses until the full lineup is complete for &quot;Burning Down The House&quot; about one-third of the way in. Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz&#39;s Tom Tom Club also performed &quot;Genius Of Love.&quot; And who can forget Byrne&#39;s big suit?<br /><br /><p>&quot;Stones At The Max&quot; featured performances from Rolling Stones concerts on the band&#39;s 1990 Urban Jungle tour. The fact that it was filmed in IMAX and I saw it at Toronto&#39;s Cinesphere made the movie special, as the size and resolution of the images were amazing — even if the band wasn&#39;t what it once was, even then. But it still includes decent performances of such favourites as &quot;Start Me Up,&quot; &quot;Tumbling Dice,&quot; &quot;Ruby Tuesday,&quot; &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; &quot;You Can&#39;t Always Get What You Want,&quot; &quot;Happy,&quot; &quot;Paint It Black,&quot; &quot;Sympathy For The Devil,&quot; &quot;Street Fighting Man,&quot; &quot;It&#39;s Only Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll,&quot; &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;(I Can&#39;t Get No) Satisfaction.&quot;</p><p>Tell me about your favourite concert films in the Comments section below.</p>—Steve McLean]]>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a684bd2a970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Shonen Knife" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a684bd2a970c " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a684bd2a970c-800wi" title="Shonen Knife" /></a> <br /> I saw Osaka, Japan female trio <strong>Shonen Knife </strong>(pictured above) perform for the fourth time a week-and-a-half ago and have been listening to some of its albums since then, and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that it&#39;s my favourite all-woman band — both on record and especially on stage.<br /><br />Singer/guitarist Naoko Yamano formed the band in 1981 and has been playing with a variety of drummers and bassists ever since. Yamano is 48, but her looks and music remain as youthful as ever and you can&#39;t help but be charmed by her and her music. It&#39;s a blend of girl group pop and Ramones-style punk with occasional elements of head-banging metal thrown in for good measure. The playing is somewhat amateurish and the lyrics — sung in often mangled English and Japanese — frequently make little sense, but that&#39;s part of Shonen Knife&#39;s appeal.<br /><br />Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Red Kross and Wesley Willis have all been Shonen Knife fans. You should be too.<br /><br />This got me thinking about my other favourite all-female bands, which excludes the great vocal girl groups of the &#39;60s who played with male backing musicians, and such current favourites as Tegan And Sara, The Pepper Pots and Gossip who do likewise.<br /><br />I came up with a list of such groups and, although many of them didn&#39;t have&#0160; or haven&#39;t had long careers, they&#39;ve all made music which has brightened up my life. I&#39;ve included an alphabetical list of nine, with brief descriptions, and a list of 20 honourable mentions to come up with a final total of 30 all-female bands that you should check out.<br /><br /><strong>The Bangles</strong> <br />The Bangles formed in Los Angeles in the early &#39;80s and reached their commercial peak later in the decade with three albums and such singles as &quot;Going Down To Liverpool&quot; (which featured Leonard Nimoy in its video), the Prince-written &quot;Manic Monday,&quot; &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian,&quot; a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#39;s &quot;Hazy Shade Of Winter&quot; and the ballad &quot;Eternal Flame.&quot; The band broke up for a decade but reformed in 1999 and have continued to perform and record.<br /><br /><strong>Cub </strong><br />This Vancouver &quot;cuddlecore&quot; trio released three studio albums, a compilation and a number of singles and EPs in the &#39;90s, and earned a decent following with its take on pop-punk before Robynn Iwata went on to form I Am Spoonbender in San Francisco.&#0160; My favourite songs include &quot;My Chinchilla,&quot; &quot;She&#39;s Like A Rainbow&quot; and &quot;New York City.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>The Go-Go&#39;s</strong> <br />The Go-Go&#39;s formed in Los Angeles in 1978 and made rock history as the first all-woman band that both wrote its own songs and played its own instruments to top the Billboard album sales chart with 1981&#39;s &quot;Beauty And The Beat.&quot; The singles &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; and &quot;We Got The Beat&quot; were both huge hits from that LP. &quot;Vacation&quot; followed the next year and the title track was another hit, as was &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; from 1984&#39;s &quot;Talk Show.&quot; The Go-Go&#39;s broke up in 1985 but reformed in the &#39;90s and released &quot;God Bless The Go-Go&#39;s&quot; in 2001. I&#39;d recommend the 1994 two-disc compilation, &quot;Return To The Valley Of The Go-Go&#39;s,&quot; for a good overview of the group.<br /><br /><strong>Gore Gore Girls</strong><br />This Detroit garage rock quartet was formed by singer/guitarist Amy Gore in 1997 and took its name from a 1972 B-movie. The group released 2000&#39;s &quot;Strange Girls&quot; and 2002&#39;s &quot;Up All Night&quot; before really coming into its own with 2007&#39;s &quot;Get The Gore,&quot; which was produced by Jim Diamond (White Stripes). The album includes covers of The Crystals&#39; &quot;All Grown Up&quot; and Terry Jacks&#39; &quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; as well as raunchy rockers &quot;Fox In A Box&quot; and &quot;Pleasure Unit.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>L7 </strong><br />This Los Angeles band was sometimes associated with the grunge movement but was more closely affiliated with the early &#39;90s feminist &quot;Riot Grrrl&quot; scene. L7&#39;s third album, 1992&#39;s Butch Vig-produced &quot;Bricks Are Heavy, was its most successful largely due to the single &quot;Pretend We&#39;re Dead&quot; and is generally considered the group&#39;s best. I&#39;d say that the final studio album, 1999&#39;s &quot;Slap-Happy,&quot; is just as strong.<br /><br /><strong>Magneta Lane</strong><br />This Toronto trio formed in 2003 and released &quot;The Constant Lover&quot; EP the next year. The MSTRKRFT-produced Dancing With Daggers was one of my favourite albums of 2006, with its danceable alt.rock and pop tunes, sultry vocals and effective guitar work from Lexi Valentine, and solid rhythms from bassist French and drummer Nadia King. This year&#39;s &quot;Gambling With God&quot; follows a similar pattern, but doesn&#39;t work quite as effectively.<br /><br /><strong>Maow</strong><br />This Vancouver-based trio released just one spunky and punky album with 16 songs that averaged about a minute-and-a-half each, but there&#39;s a lot of pleasure to be had in that short time span. Guitarist Tobey Black, bassist Corinna Hammond and a drummer you may have since heard about named Neko Case shared vocals on 1996&#39;s &quot;The Unforgiving Sounds Of... Maow.&quot; Case obviously stands out most, particularly on the album&#39;s two covers: Wanda Jackson&#39;s &quot;Mean Mean Man&quot; and Nancy Sinatra&#39;s &quot;How Does That Grab You, Darlin?&quot;<br /><br /><strong>The Runaways</strong><br />Guitarist Joan Jett and drummer Sandy West formed The Runaways as teenagers in Los Angeles in 1975 after producer/svengali and all-around creep Kim Fowley helped recruit other members, including guitarist Lita Ford, singer Cherie Currie and briefly bassist Micki Steele (who later joined The Bangles). The band played a mix of heavy glam and early punk rock through four studio albums before breaking up in 1979. &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; is the group&#39;s best known song, but you should check out former bassist Vicki Blue&#39;s 2004 documentary, &quot;Edgeplay: A Film About The Runaways,&quot; for an excellent overview of the group&#39;s brief but influential and tempestuous existence. A feature film on the band starring Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart will be released next year.<br /><br /><strong>The Slits</strong><br />This British band fronted by anything but bashful vocalist Ari Up was formed in 1976 and mixed post-punk, experimental and reggae elements on its two albums before it split up in 1982 after recording such gems as &quot;Typical Girls,&quot; &quot;Instant Hit&quot; and a cover of &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine.&quot; Up (the stepdaughter of Sex Pistols/P.I.L. singer John Lydon, even though she&#39;s only six years younger than him) and bassist Tessa Pollitt reformed The Slits in 2005, I finally got to see the group for the first time (and fell in lust with keyboardist/backing vocalist Hollie Cook, the daughter of Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook) last year, and am interested in hearing the just-released &quot;Trapped Animal&quot; LP.<br /><br /><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong><br />The 5.6.7.8&#39;s (Japan, current)<br />Au Revoir Simone (U.S., current)<br />The Belle Stars (England, 1980-1986)<br />The Bodysnatchers (England, 1979-1981)<br />The Corn Sisters (Canada/U.S., 1998-2002)<br />The Donnas (U.S., current)<br />Electrelane (England, 1998-2007)<br />Fifth Column (Canada, 1980-1995)<br />Gitogito Hustler (Japan, current)<br />The Hedrons (Scotland, current)<br />Luscious Jackson (U.S., 1991-2000)<br />The Murmurs (U.S., 1991-1999)<br />The Pack A.D. (Canada, current)<br />The Pandoras (U.S., 1983-1991)<br />The Raincoats (England, 1977-1984, 1993-now)<br />Sahara Hotnights (Sweden, current)<br />Screamin&#39; Sirens (U.S., 1980s)<br />Sleater-Kinney (U.S., 1994-2006)<br />Vivian Girls (U.S., current)<br />We&#39;ve Got A Fuzzbox And We&#39;re Gonna Use It (England, 1985-1990)<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6792d7a970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="The Fleshtones" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a6792d7a970c " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6792d7a970c-800wi" title="The Fleshtones" /></a> <br /> Halloween will be here in five nights, and there will be lots of parties on and surrounding it. I often get asked for music recommendations for such events, so I&#39;m going to provide you with some suitably spooky tunes for your ghoulish get-together and tell you of other records that should be avoided like a plague of zombies.<br /><br />If you&#39;re having trouble getting younger kids to sleep after their trick-or-treating candy sugar highs, let me suggest an album that originally came out on vinyl in 1962 and is still scaring children today on CD. The original &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents Ghost Stories For Young People&quot; that spooked me as a a youngster offered an introduction and vignettes by the master of suspense as well as six tales. The 2009 version comes with a second disc dubbed &quot;Famous Monsters Speak&quot; that includes sound effects.<br /><br />The other Halloween album I had as a kid was a 1974 sound effects LP titled &quot;Sounds Of Terror!&quot; that opened with a re-recording of &quot;Monster Mash,&quot; the evergreen classic by the late but <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/news/43487/fourteen-reasons-why-bobby-boris-pickett-was-cool" target="_blank">forever cool</a> Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett. A used vinyl copy is going for $35 on Amazon.com. <br /><br />Even though &quot;Sounds Of Terror!&quot; is out of print, there are a number of other Halloween sound effects albums on the market. Although I haven&#39;t heard them, I&#39;ve read positive reviews of &quot;Haunted House Horrors,&quot; &quot;Ghost &amp; Ghoul Sounds&quot; and the oh so creatively titled &quot;Scary Sound Effects.&quot;<br /><br />Rob Zombie assembled 1998&#39;s &quot;Halloween Hootenanny,&quot; and you&#39;d expect a dude like that to know what he&#39;s doing. He does, as original tracks from Reverend Horton Heat, The Bomboras, Southern Culture On the Skids, Rocket From The Crypt, Amazing Royal Crowns and Swingin&#39; Neckbreakers, as well as Los Straitjackets covering the &quot;Munsters Theme,&quot; make for a fine collection for those into garage rock, psychobilly and surf music.<br /><br />Another 1998 compilation, &quot;Just Can&#39;t Get Enough: New Wave Halloween,&quot; uses the term &quot;new wave&quot; rather loosely. But there&#39;s some really good stuff on here, including Ministry&#39;s &quot;Everyday Is Halloween,&quot; The Ramones&#39; &quot;Pet Sematary,&quot; Comateens&#39; &quot;Munsters Theme,&quot; Dave Edmunds&#39; &quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon,&quot; Siouxsie And The Banshees&#39; &quot;Halloween&quot; and The Misfits&#39; &quot;Halloween.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Big Monster Bash, Vol. 1&quot; is a pretty good 21-track collection of rock-and-roll, rockabilly, surf, instrumental and garage rock highlighted by High Noon&#39;s &quot;Crazy Fever,&quot; Jack Knife And The Sharps&#39; &quot;Justifiable Homicide&quot; and Vibra Champs&#39; &quot;Dig Me A Hole.&quot; <br /><br />Rhino&#39;s 1991 &quot;Halloween Hits&quot; compilation is aimed at families and includes the original versions of &quot;Monster Mash,&quot; &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as well as such lesser known songs as Jumpin&#39; Gene Simmons&#39; &quot;Haunted House,&quot; The Five Blobs&#39; &quot;Blob&quot; and The Ran-Dells&#39; &quot;The Martian Hop,&quot; and two personal favourites, Sheb Wooley&#39;s &quot;Purple People Eater&quot; and Screamin&#39; Jay Hawkins&#39; &quot;I Put A Spell On You.&quot; <br /><br />An even better bet is 1990&#39;s &quot;Elvira Presents Haunted Hits,&quot; which includes all of the above-mentioned songs aside from &quot;The Martian Hop,&quot; but also gives you Alice Cooper&#39;s &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare,&quot; The Cramps&#39; &quot;I Was A Teenage Werewolf and &quot; LaVern Baker&#39;s &quot;Voodoo Voodoo.&quot; <br /><br />If you&#39;re a sucker for album covers showing lots of cleavage, I feel obligated to inform you that two lesser Elvira collections — 1994&#39;s &quot;Elvira Presents: Monster Hits&quot; and 1995&#39;s &quot;Revenge Of The Monster Hits&quot; — are also available. Like me, Elvira is a <a href="http://blogs.music.msn.ca/2009/10/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-paul-anka-has-done-better.html" target="_blank">big Tom Jones fan</a>. Unlike me, she apparently <a href="http://stevemclean.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_archive.html" target="_blank">needed stitches after losing her virginity to the Welsh superstar</a> (scroll down five items for more details). <br /><br />&quot;Ghostbusters,&quot; &quot;Monster Mash,&quot; &quot;Addams Family&quot; and &quot;Purple People Eater&quot; are dragged out yet again on &quot;Kidz Bop Halloween,&quot; where children sing all the songs. You also get &quot;Witch Doctor,&quot; &quot;Thriller,&quot; &quot;Time Warp&quot; and &quot;Somebody&#39;s Watching Me&quot; among the 13 tracks. The kids thankfully only come in to ruin the chorus of &quot;Werewolves Of London,&quot; while the rest of the song is handled by a guy who doesn&#39;t sound much different from Warren Zevon. But I really can&#39;t recommend anything from the &quot;Kidz Bop&quot; series.<br /><br />&quot;Monster Bop,&quot; on the other hand, is a completely different story — especially for fans of vintage rock-and-roll. The 2000 album features 30 songs remastered from original 45s from the &#39;50s, including Carl Bonafede&#39;s &quot;Were Wolf,&quot; Rod Willis&#39; &quot;The Cat,&quot; Jack &amp; Kim&#39;s &quot;Midnight Monsters Hop,&quot; Scottie Stuart&#39;s &quot;Nightmare,&quot; Jim Burgett&#39;s &quot;Jekyll And Hyde,&quot; The Castle Kings&#39; &quot;You Can Get Him Frankenstein&quot; and Joe Johnson&#39;s &quot;The Gila Monster.&quot;<br /><br />In a somewhat similar vein is 2005&#39;s &quot;These Ghoulish Things: Horror Hits For Halloween,&quot; a 28-track collection from the vaults that includes Duponts&#39;&quot;Screamin&#39; Ball (At Dracula Hall),&quot; Hollywood Flames&#39; &quot;Frankenstein&#39;s Den,&quot; Round Robin&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m The Wolfman,&quot; Kac-ties&#39; &quot;Mr. Were-Wolf,&quot; The Swingin&#39; Phillies&#39; &quot;Frankenstein&#39;s Party&quot; and Bo Diddley&#39;s &quot;Bo Meets The Monster.&quot;<br /><br />The &#39;50s and &#39;60s were obviously the prime decades for rock-and-roll songs with horror hooks, as you can find 31 more of them on 1994&#39;s &quot;Horror Hop,&quot; including Kip Tyler&#39;s &quot;She&#39;s My Witch,&quot; Billy Sills&#39; &quot;Night Mare,&quot; Bobby Bare&#39;s &quot;Vampira&quot; and Gary Warren&#39;s &quot;Werewolf.&quot; I&#39;d rank it third among these three similar albums, but still a notch above many others.<br /><br />Mannheim Steamroller is best known for making modern recordings of Christmas music, but the group released a 2003 double album titled &quot;Halloween,&quot; 2004&#39;s &quot;Halloween: Monster Mix&quot; and a 2006 two-CD and DVD collection titled &quot;Halloween, Vol. 2: Creatures Collection.&quot; If you&#39;re one of those people who has interest in both classical music and the New Age movement but isn&#39;t knowledgeable enough to have a full appreciation of either, these albums might be up your alley.<br /><br />Fans of director Tim Burton&#39;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and emo kids may want to check out the 2006 reissue of Danny Elfman&#39;s soundtrack, which features a bonus CD that includes Marilyn Manson, Panic! At The Disco, Fiona Apple, She Wants Revenge and Fall Out Boy covering songs from the film. <br /><br />Andrew Gold is probably best known for his &#39;70s hits &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; and &quot;Thank You For Being A Friend,&quot; or perhaps as the guy who sang the theme for &quot;Mad About You,&quot; but he also released a 1996 album called &quot;Andrew Gold&#39;s Halloween Howls&quot; that included original songs as well as &quot;The Addams Family&quot; theme and &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot; There&#39;s no reason to buy this.<br /><br />If someone spiked Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks&#39; acorns with speed, they&#39;d sound like the Countdown Singers, who share 2000&#39;s &quot;Monster Mash &amp; Other Songs Of Horror&quot; with the Orlando Pops Orchestra. It&#39;s criminal for &quot;Love Potion No. 9,&quot; &quot;In The Midnight Hour&quot; and &quot;Clap For The Wolfman&quot; to be treated this way.<br /><br />All of the above albums can be purchased online from Amazon, and some could possibly even be shipped to arrive at your home in time for Halloween. <br /><br />The newest and one of the best Halloween albums is a <a href="http://www.yeproc.com/news.php?articleId=6297" target="_blank">digital-only release</a> available from Yep Roc&#39;s website. &quot;Rockin&#39; Bones&quot; features some of my favourite artists from the label — including Th&#39; Legendary Shack*Shakers, Los Straitjackets, The Fleshtones (pictured above), Dexter Romweber, The Minus 5, Laika &amp; The Cosmonauts, Jason Ringenberg, Big Sandy &amp; Fly-Rite Boys, Heavy Trash and Robyn Hitchcock — performing &quot;15 tombstone shakin&#39; hits.&quot;<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for more obscure material, here&#39;s an album-length playlist I compiled on a mix tape from my vinyl collection a number of years ago that I titled &quot;Halloween In The Garage.&quot; It&#39;s proven to be quite popular at parties. You might be able to find some of these songs on the Internet if it&#39;s too much of an inconvenience to come to my house to hear them:<br /><br />Dream Syndicate - &quot;Halloween&quot;<br />Fleshtones - &quot;I Was A Teenage Zombie&quot;<br />Sunglasses After Dark - &quot;Hellhag Shuffle&quot;<br />Guana Batz - &quot;Werewolf Blues&quot;<br />Sickidz - &quot;She&#39;s My Witch&quot;<br />Condition - &quot;Ghost Train&quot;<br />Zamboni Drivers - &quot;Skatin&#39; Ghost&quot;<br />Miners Of Muzo - &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot;<br />Revillos - &quot;She&#39;s Fallen In Love With A Monster Man&quot;<br />Jerry Vile - &quot;The Attack Of The Blood Sucking Poodles From Hell&quot;<br />3-D Invisibles - &quot;Where Creatures Roam&quot;<br />Pharaohs - &quot;Tomb Of The Dead&quot;<br />Creeping Pumpkins - &quot;Better Off Without You&quot;<br />Skeptics - &quot;Legend Of The Headless Surfer&quot;<br />Scattered Limbs - &quot;Walk Without Me&quot;<br />and a quadruple-shot from Deja Voodoo: <br />&quot;Skeletons At My Party,&quot; &quot;Cemetery,&quot; &quot;Dead Daddy Dead&quot; and &quot;Monsters In My Garage&quot;<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a61a3398970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Lil Wayne" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a61a3398970b " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a61a3398970b-800wi" title="Lil Wayne" /></a> <br /> Rap star Lil Wayne (real name Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr.) took a plea deal on a gun possession charge on Thursday and is expected to serve at least eight months of his year-long sentence in a New York prison. But Weezy still has more legal troubles ahead of him, as he also faces drug and gun charges in Arizona in connection with a January 2008 arrest. The trial is scheduled to begin on March 30.<br /><br />Former TLC member T-Boz (real name Tionne Tenese Watkins) also admitted this week that she threatened Arista Records president Clive Davis with a gun during a dispute over the female R&amp;B group&#39;s royalty payments for its smash hit &quot;Crazy Sexy Cool&quot; album a decade ago. No charges were laid in that instance, but these two cases got me to thinking about other music artists who&#39;ve got into trouble with guns this decade. Here&#39;s a rundown:<br /><br />Jamal Michael Barrow, a rap protege of Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs better known as &quot;Shyne,&quot; was involved in a December 1999 New York City night club shooting that left three people injured and resulted in him facing charges of attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2001 and was released earlier this month. He was immediately apprehended by federal authorities, however, and officials are deciding whether he should be deported to his native Belize.<br /><br />Cordazar Calvin Broadus — better known as rapper, actor and television show host Snoop Dogg — was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm and transportation of a controlled substance after a gun and marijuana were found in his car at a Burbank, Calif. airport in October 2006. He was arrested again on similar charges the next month after police said a search turned up marijuana, a firearm and cocaine in a false compartment in a car that he was riding in.<br /><br />Shawn Corey Carter, the hip-hop mogul better known as Jay-Z, was arrested on a weapon charge in April 2001 when the bodyguard he was in a car with was found with a loaded gun in his waistband.<br /><br />Rock And Roll Hall Of Famer David Crosby — who&#39;s recorded as a solo artist, with The Byrds and in various formats with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young — served prison time for various drug and gun charges in the &#39;80s. He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, illegal possession of a hunting knife, illegal possession of ammunition and illegal possession of about one ounce of marijuana in 2004.<br /><br />Dwight Grant, better known as Philadelphia rapper Beanie Sigel, was found guilty of federal weapons charges and sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison in 2004. He was acquitted of attempted murder (in connection with the 2003 shooting of a man) in September 2005. Sigel was shot twice in the right arm in May 2006 when five men attempted to carjack him at an intersection.<br /><br />Clifford Joseph Harris, Jr., better known as rapper T.I. — whose &quot;King,&quot; &quot;T.I. vs. T.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Paper Trail&quot; albums have each debuted at the top of the U.S. sales chart over the past three years — was arrested for possession of three unregistered machine guns and two silencers and possession of firearms by a convicted felon in October 2007. He struck a plea deal and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison this past March.<br /><br />Shawntae Harris, a rapper/actress better known as Da Brat, pleaded guilty in 2001 to misdemeanor reckless conduct after beating a woman with a gun during a 2000 nightclub dispute in an Atlanta, Ga. suburb. She received a year&#39;s probation, 80 hours of community service and a $1,000 fine.<br /><br />Torrence Hatch, better known as Louisiana rapper Lil Boosie, recently pleaded guilty to weapon and drug possession charges after police reportedly seized marijuana and a gun from his car last fall. He&#39;s been sentenced to two years in prison but that could be reduced by about half if he behaves well behind bars.<br /><br />Stanley Howse, who goes by the name Flesh-n-Bone in the rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and has also released four solo albums, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after being convicted for pulling an AK-47 assault rifle and threatening a man and violating probation. He was released early and arrested this past April for gun possession, but the charges were dropped.<br /><br />John David Jackson, who has sold more than three million albums in the U.S. under his stage name Fabolous, was arrested for possessing an unlicensed gun in his car in early 2003. His bodyguard later showed proof of ownership for the gun. Fabolous was shot in the right leg in October 2006 after leaving a restaurant owned by hip-hop entrepreneur Diddy. Police claimed they found unlicensed, loaded guns in a car he escaped in with three other men, and arrests were made.<br /><br />Albert Johnson, who goes by the name of Prodigy in hip-hop duo Mobb Deep and as a solo artist, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison in October 2007 after pleading guilty to firearms offences. He began serving his time in February 2008.<br /><br />Marshall Bruce Mathers III, better known as Eminem, received two years probation in April 2001 for carrying a concealed weapon after being arrested for pistol-whipping a man who was allegedly kissing his wife outside a Warren, Mich. bar in June 2000. Prosecutors dropped an assault with a dangerous weapon charge as part of a plea agreement.<br /><br />Corey Miller, who prophetically rapped under the name C-Murder, was originally convicted in September 2003 of the 2002 fatal shooting of a fan at a Harvey, La. nightclub. A mistrial was declared and he was placed under house arrest. The retrial began this past August and he was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.<br />C-Murder also pled no contest to two counts of attempted second-degree murder this past May in connection with a 2001 incident at a Baton Rouge, La. nightclub where he fired a pistol at the owner and a bouncer after they refused to admit him with the weapon. He was sentenced to 10 years, with credit for time served.<br /><br />Jason Jerome Phillips, a member of hip-hop group The LOX who goes by the name of Jadakiss, was arrested on marijuana and gun possession charges in North Carolina in July 2004 after police said they found less than an ounce of marijuana and two loaded .45-caliber pistols in his vehicle. He reached a plea agreement in March 2005 in which he paid a $900 fine and was given deferred prosecution. Jadakiss was indicted on gun and drug charges in New York City in February 2007 after a loaded handgun and marijuana were found in a car he was a passenger in.<br /><br />Phil Spector scored a number one hit with &quot;To Know Him Is To Love Him&quot; as a member of The Teddy Bears in 1958, but gained more fame as a record producer through the &#39;60s and &#39;70s. He had a reputation as a gun fanatic and was found guilty of second-degree murder earlier this year in connection with the February 2003 shooting death of nightclub hostess and actress Lana Clarkson. He&#39;s serving a 19-year prison sentence.<br /><br />Jayceon Terrell Taylor, who&#39;s released two U.S. sales chart-topping albums under the name The Game, was arrested after allegedly threatening a man with a gun during a pick-up basketball game in a Los Angeles school yard in February 2007. He faced up to five years in prison, but was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 150 hours of community service and three years probation after pleading no contest to a felony weapons charge in February 2008. The Game only spent eight days behind bars and his lawyers have filed a lawsuit against him, claiming that he owes them almost $35,000 in legal fees.<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a66804c3970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Ian McCulloch" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a66804c3970c " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a66804c3970c-800wi" title="Ian McCulloch" /></a> <br /> The passing of 22 years may have obscured my memory, but I think the first concert I attended where the band played an entire album from start to finish was at London, England&#39;s Town And Country Club in June 1987. The band was Husker Du and the album was its final studio effort, the 20-song &quot;Warehouse: Songs and Stories.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#39;t recall the gig being advertised as such, so maybe Bob Mould and Grant Hart were just so pissed off at each other by that point that it was easier to play all of &quot;Warehouse&quot; than to discuss creating a diverse set list. I liked the album then and still do, but was disappointed that I didn&#39;t hear any other songs, especially since Husker Du broke up shortly after that.<br /><br />There have probably been other occasions since then when I&#39;ve seen someone perform an album in its entirety, though none come immediately to mind. But since earlier this decade when the All Tomorrow&#39;s Parties festivals started promoting their Don&#39;t Look Back series where groups play a single album from start to finish, the idea has really started to catch on.<br /><br />The Stooges (&quot;Fun House&quot;), Sonic Youth (&quot;Daydream Nation&quot;), Melvins (&quot;Houdini&quot;), Slint (&quot;Spiderland&quot;), GZA (&quot;Liquid Swords&quot;), Public Enemy (&quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;), Mission of Burma (&quot;Vs.&quot;), Sebadoh (&quot;Bubble and Scrape&quot;), Cat Power (&quot;The Covers Record&quot;), Built To Spill (&quot;Perfect From Now On&quot;), Meat Puppets (&quot;Meat Puppets II&quot;), Tortoise (&quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot;), Thurston Moore (&quot;Psychic Hearts&quot;), Suicide (&quot;Suicide&quot;), The Feelies (&quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot;), Sufjan Stevens (&quot;Seven Swans&quot;), The Saints (&quot;I&#39;m Stranded&quot;) and Young Marble Giants (&quot;Colossal Youth&quot;) have all been part of Don&#39;t Look Back at ATP events in the U.S., Europe and Australia.<br /><br />The Cult&#39;s best album, 1985&#39;s &quot;Love,&quot; was revised on stage this past summer. Liz Phair honoured the 15th birthday of &quot;Exile In Guyville&quot; with a series of shows last year. Motley Crue marked the 20th anniversary of &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; by performing it in concert earlier this year, and the Pixies are doing the same thing now with &quot;Doolittle.&quot; <br /><br />Steely Dan are by and large alternating &quot;Aja&quot; and &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; on current dates, while recent Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band concerts have featured either the &quot;Born To Run&quot; or &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot; LPs. I&#39;ll experience Devo performing &quot;Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot; and &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; on back-to-back nights at Toronto&#39;s Phoenix Concert Theatre next month.<br /><br />And on Tuesday night I saw Echo &amp; The Bunnymen mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Ocean Rain&quot; by playing it from front to back at Toronto&#39;s Queen Elizabeth Theatre with assistance from a local eight-piece string section and percussionist. Print ads said the Liverpool, England group would be accompanied by an orchestra, but frontman Ian McCulloch (pictured above) conceded that it was a &quot;humble&quot; orchestra. I was shocked that the notoriously brash singer (who blew off an interview with me earlier this month) even knew the meaning of &quot;humble.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ocean Rain&quot; is generally considered the high water mark of Echo records, and McCulloch has modestly called it the best album ever made. But I hold 1980&#39;s &quot;Crocodiles&quot; in equally high esteem and have enjoyed pretty much all of the group&#39;s catalogue, so I was a bit unsure about attending a concert focused solely on one album.<br /><br />But the Bunnymen did this show the way they should be done.<br /><p>The group opened the concert in its normal six-person format with a 12-song set heavy on old favourites (including &quot;Going Up,&quot; &quot;Villiers Terrace,&quot; &quot;Bring On The Dancing Horses,&quot; &quot;The Disease,&quot; &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and &quot;The Cutter&quot;) and &quot;Think I Need It To,&quot; the excellent first single from Echo &amp; The Bunnymen&#39;s <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/75721/echo-the-bunnymen-the-fountain" target="_blank">fine new album</a>, &quot;The Fountain.&quot; </p><p>McCulloch&#39;s voice wasn&#39;t at its best (he blamed it on too many &quot;ciggies&quot; and interviews) and the group&#39;s other founding member, guitarist Will Sergeant, is a great aural craftsman but a less than riveting performer. But the 50-minute opening set left me thinking I&#39;d already seen a great concert.</p>The expanded band returned 20 minutes later, with McCulloch still wearing the sunglasses and pea coat from the first set, and launched into &quot;Ocean Rain.&quot; Much of the album was made in Paris with a 35-piece orchestra, and I thought that the strings played a more prominent role on opener &quot;Silver&quot; in its recorded version than it did on Tuesday. But the flourish of cellos and violins during &quot;Thorn Of Crowns&quot; was very impressive and the chimes added to &quot;Seven Seas&quot; worked brilliantly. And <a href="http://blogs.music.msn.ca/2009/10/my-the-twilight-saga-new-moon-soundtrack.html" target="_blank">&quot;The Killing Moon&quot;</a> remains one of the most majestic and hauntingly beautiful songs ever, as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br /><br />McCulloch asked for questions from the crowd while awaiting delivery of a cigarette so he could openly flout the non-smoking law during an excellent version of &quot;My Kingdom.&quot; A couple of fans obviously didn&#39;t comprehend the concept of performing a full album and yelled requests for songs not found on &quot;Ocean Rain.&quot; The cellos shone through on the closing title ballad, after which McCulloch said &quot;Thank you, Toronto&quot; and walked off.<br /><br />There was a rousing standing ovation that continued even after the house lights briefly came on, so the basic sextet returned to play the dark and brooding &quot;All My Colours&quot; and rip through &quot;Lips Like Sugar&quot; before the night drew to a final conclusion.<br /><br />The renovated 1,256-seat theatre wasn&#39;t completely full, probably due to the concert&#39;s $65 ticket price — which was more than McCulloch and company would normally be able to charge. But that&#39;s one of the things about these types of shows. By framing them as events, bands and promoters can try and justify higher prices. <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if the big bucks also covered a small food budget, but having a woman invite me to sample from a tray of spring rolls and sushi in the lobby during the intermission was a nice, if unnecessary, touch.<br /><br />Entire album performances are the flavour of the moment. In the case of the Pixies with &quot;Doolittle,&quot; it unfortunately seems to be another way for one of my favourite bands to exploit fans while not creating any new material. With Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, whose new album shows as much vitality as anything the group has done over its almost 30-year recording career, it&#39;s another way to reward its followers.<br /><br />If more bands follow that path and pattern their album shows in a similar way to Echo&#39;s, I&#39;d be happy if this trend continued. These things should be more than just cash grabs.<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6084eef970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Axl Rose" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54f91645288340120a6084eef970b " src="http://sneil.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f91645288340120a6084eef970b-800wi" title="Axl Rose" /></a> <br /> The Internet was buzzing with news on Monday that Guns N&#39; Roses will tour across Canada to begin the new year. Of course this is the band that didn&#39;t deliver its disappointing &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; album until 13 years after work began on it, so there&#39;s probably good reason to be leery about concert promoter Live Nation&#39;s announcement of shows in Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, Hamilton, London, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Moncton and Halifax from Jan. 13 to Feb. 4.<br /><br />Why do I have my doubts? Let&#39;s count down the ways:<br /><br />10. The tour dates haven&#39;t yet been posted on the GNR web site.<br /><br />9. GNR was slapped with a $1-million U.S. plagiarism lawsuit earlier this month over claims that the group used parts of two songs by German electronic musician Ulrich Schnauss in &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; track &quot;Riad N&#39; The Bedouins&quot; without permission. GNR manager Irving Azoff says the band will &quot;vigorously contest&quot; the claims in the suit. That would be a lot easier to do if it wasn&#39;t planning a major tour.<br /><br />8. Tommy Stinson is supposed to be GNR&#39;s bassist on the tour. But he knows deep down that he&#39;s just doing it for the paycheque and that his heart will always be with The Replacements. He now has less than three months to get Paul Westerberg and Chris Mars onside for the Replacements reunion tour. Now that would be truly exciting news if it happens.<br /><br />7. Buckethead is no longer in GNR. If you can&#39;t see a guy on stage wearing an empty KFC bucket on his head, is it really worth shelling out big bucks for the concert?<br /><br />6. GNR is supposed to play four shows in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan in December before the Canadian tour. Someone could eat some improperly prepared blowfish while there, and the results would likely be deadly.<br /><br />5. &quot;Rockabye Baby! Lullaby Renditions of Guns N&#39; Roses&quot; is scheduled to hit stores on Nov. 10. The <a href="http://www.rockabyebabymusic.com/ecom2/index.php/lullaby-renditions-of-guns-n-roses.html" target="_blank">web site</a> for the album of instrumental lullabies says that &quot;guitars and drums are traded for soothing mellotrons, vibraphones and bells, and the volume is turned down from an eleven to a two.&quot; GNR main man Axl Rose might be so afraid of being called a sellout or a softie that he might cancel the tour to avoid possible heckling.<br /><br />4. After all the hype and build-up leading to the Nov. 23, 2008 release of &quot;Chinese Democracy,&quot; the album essentially tanked and didn&#39;t come close to meeting sales expectations. If people didn&#39;t want to buy the album, why would they want to buy concert tickets for a band that&#39;s 20 years past its peak period?<br /><br />3. Rose has infamously walked off stage during concerts before, so what&#39;s stopping him from bailing on an entire tour?<br /><br />2. Rose has likewise been notoriously late for showing up at concerts. What if he arrives in Winnipeg in February?<br /><br />1. Speaking of Winnipeg, who&#39;d want to spend time there in the middle of winter if you didn&#39;t have to?<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

The singer joins fellow vocalists Marc Anthony and Gloria Estefan, as well as her musician husband Emilio, as a member of the ownership team. The Dolphins&#39; stadium has been named after Parrothead favourite Jimmy Buffett&#39;s Land Shark beer. While it&#39;s unique for a team to have so many celebrity stakeholders, the Dolphins aren&#39;t the only team with connections to music artists.<br /><br />The late singing cowboy Gene Autry used to own the California Angels baseball team, while Jon Bon Jovi paid a reported $8 million to cover half of the start-up costs for the now defunct Arena Football League&#39;s Philadelphia Soul in 2004. Country singer Tim McGraw (the son of former major league baseball pitcher Tug McGraw) became a minority owner of the Nashville Kats Arena Football League team in 2005, but the franchise was shut down two years later.<br /><br />Country singers Conway Twitty, Jerry Reed and Larry Gatlin were shareholders of the Nashville Sounds when the expansion minor league baseball team was formed in 1978.<br /><br />Elton John bought an ownership stake in England&#39;s Watford Football Club in 1976. He sold it earlier this decade, but remains the soccer team&#39;s honorary life president. <br /><br />Entrepreneurial hip-hop star Jay-Z is part of the ownership group that bought the New Jersey Nets National Basketball Association team for $300 million in 2004. <br /><br />Rapper Nelly is part of the ownership group that owns the NBA&#39;s Charlotte Bobcats.<br /><br />R&amp;B singer Usher joined an investor group that purchased the NBA&#39;s Cleveland Cavaliers for $375 million in 2005. <br /><br />Former 98 Degrees member and solo artist Nick Lachey became a one-third owner of minor league baseball team Tacoma Rainiers, the AAA affiliate of the Seattle Mariners, in 2006. <br /><br />Actor/singer Russell Crowe (he fronted a band called 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts and has released solo records) and a business partner purchased the South Sydney Rabbitohs of Australia&#39;s National Rugby League for $3 million in 2006. <br /><br />Destiny&#39;s Child member Michelle Williams purchased a stake in the Chicago Sky of the Women&#39;s National Basketball Association in 2006. <br /><br />Canadian crooner Michael Buble is part of a group that owns the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League.<br /><br />I can&#39;t really call myself a fan of any of the above artists, and they come from a variety of musical genres, but here&#39;s a track list for an imaginary hits compilation featuring all of them:<br /><br />1. Fergie — &quot;Fergalicious&quot;<br />2. Marc Anthony — &quot;I Need To Know&quot;<br />3. Gloria and Emilio Estefan — &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&quot;<br />4. Jimmy Buffett — &quot;Margaritaville&quot;<br />5. Gene Autry — &quot;Back In The Saddle Again&quot;<br />6. Bon Jovi — &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot;<br />7. Tim McGraw — &quot;I Like It, I Love It&quot;<br />8. Conway Twitty — &quot;It&#39;s Only Make Believe&quot;<br />9. Jerry Reed — &quot;When You&#39;re Hot, You&#39;re Hot&quot;<br />10. Larry Gatlin — &quot;I Just Wish You Were Someone I Love&quot;<br />11. Elton John — &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;<br />12. Jay-Z — &quot;Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)&quot;<br />13. Nelly — &quot;Hot In Herre&quot;<br />14. Usher — &quot;Nice &amp; Slow&quot;<br />15. Nick Lachey — &quot;What&#39;s Left Of Me&quot;<br />16. Russell Crowe — &quot;Raewyn&quot;<br />17. Michelle Williams — &quot;The Greatest&quot;<br />18. Michael Buble — &quot;Everything&quot;<br /><br />—Steve McLean]]>

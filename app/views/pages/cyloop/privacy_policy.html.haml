We ask you to show your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy in different ways, depending on your relationship to the Site. The procedures for consenting to this Policy are (a) less formal if you are simply a casual Site Visitor, and (b) more formal if you are seeking to become a Member or a Contributing Artist featured on the Site.

%br
%p
  Due to the nature of communications that may take place on our Site, and due to federal policy in favor of protecting children under 13 years of age (as reflected in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), WE DO NOT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO WE KNOW ARE UNDER 13 TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR SITE OR SERVICES.

  3.	The Types Of Information You May Provide
%br
%p
  Information you may provide while visiting our Site or while participating in our Services falls into two broad categories: (i) personally identifiable information, and (ii) aggregate information. We use the term 'Personally Identifiable Information' to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, birth date, financial information, photograph, telephone number or any combination of information that could be used to identify you. 'Anonymous Information' is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of our Services, your access to works by our Contributing Artists, or the pages on our Site that you visit most frequently. These two categories of information can be further divided into (iii) information that we collect from, and that you provide to us ('Site-Directed Information'), and (iv) information you intend to provide or make available to other Members on our Site ('Member-Directed Information'). Our Privacy Policy governs all Site-Directed Information - whether this information is personally identifiable information or anonymous information - and does not govern Member-Directed Information, as we have no direct control over the collection or use of Member-Directed Information.
%br
%h3

This form asks for contact information, which includes such items as (i) name; (ii) mailing address; (iii) birth date (for COPPA and eligibility purposes); (iv) gender; and (v) email address.  The registration process provides Members and Contributing Artists with a user name and password, which allow them to gain access to the Website and Services to which they have subscribed.  Our system relies on user names as the public 'identifier' for the particular Member.
  %br
  %br
  %h4
    4.2.	Band Information.
  %span
    If you register your musical group with our Site as a Contributing Artist, you will be asked to provide us with the first and last names of all band members, and gender of all band members.

In addition, to facilitate locating friends, you can search for particular Members' profiles by using their full name or e-mail address. Our search features are structured to that you must first know your friend's full name or email address in order to locate their profile.

If you choose to request such a invitation, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will then send the friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store the information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and the friend may contact us in accordance with Section 10 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out) to request the removal of this information from our databases.
  %br
  %br
  %h4
    4.5.	Communications with Other Members.
  %span
    In registering under the Website, Members and Contributing Artists indicate an interest in exchanging information with other Members, subject to any Privacy Controls imposed.  To allow such communications, we provide information to identify individual users, in the form of Members' and Contributing Artists' user names.  We seek to limit the information provided through our system to the minimum information needed to identify a participant in communications and other exchanges.

    4.6.	Other Information Exchanges.
  %span
    The Website allows Members and Contributing Artists (i) to provide and receive information in a range of forms on an unlimited number of topics, and (ii) to engage in other activity through Website discussions that may include, at the option of the user, an exchange of personally identifiable information.

  %br
  %br
  %h4
    4.7.	Use of Profiles in Promotions.
  %span
    We believe that our Members' own experiences on the Site can often act as the strongest promotion for the Site and our Services.  To promote and illustrate our Services and the Site, therefore, we may wish to post on our Home Page, and in other areas of the Site, profiles and other Content of our Members.  We assume that Members who choose not to employ our Privacy Controls are interested in (or do not object to) publicizing their profiles and related Content.  If we have used your profile or other information for these purposes, and you do not wish us to do so, please notify us as provided in Section 16 (Contact Us).  If personally identifiable information is involved, we will remove the information from our promotional material, within a reasonable period of time.
  %br
  %br
  %h4
    4.8.	Informational Notices and Bulletins.
  %span
    Periodically, we may choose to send news, bulletins, marketing materials, or other information to Members and Contributing Artists, and will use personally identifiable information to send such communications. If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 12 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).

  %span

  %h4
    4.10.	Surveys and Contests.
  %span
    Periodically, we may initiate surveys or contests at Cyloop.com, and we may request personally identifiable information from you in connection with such surveys and contests. You are free to choose whether you participate in a survey or contest. The information we request may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and this information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and appeal of this Site. We will notify you of relevant details in connection with asking for you participation in such surveys or contests.
%br
%h3
  5.	Your Responsibility for Member-Directed Information
%br
%p
  Member-Directed Information is information you intend to provide or make available to other Members or Contributing Artists on our Site.  Although we counsel you to take care if you include personally identifiable information in your Member-Directed Information, our Privacy Policy does not cover Member-Directed Information.  If you choose to disclose any personally identifiable information, any such information can be collected and used by other Members or users, and you may receive unsolicited communications as a result.  We provide a range of Services to assist you in making good choices concerning the information you disclose.  Please see Section 9 (Further Tools for Protecting Your Privacy) for a description.

  6.	Anonymous, Aggregate Information
\.
%br
%p

In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of users participating in our Services and the characteristics of visitors at our Site, and may share Anonymous Information with third parties.  Rest assured, though, that Anonymous Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you.

Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they inform us whether emails have been opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to our Members and Contributing Artists. None of this data includes personally identifiable information, and you can 'opt-out' of receiving these types of emails from us by following the directions provided in Section 10 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).

  11.	Security
%br
%p
  We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of personally identifiable Site-Directed Information you provide to us, and we take all reasonable steps to secure and safeguard this Information. Our site's password-protected section requires users to give us unique identifiers such as their user id and password. Moreover, we store all Site-Directed personally identifiable information we receive on a separate system, designed to be secure and isolated from direct connection to the Internet.  Hoodiny employees (and employees of our affiliates and Site Vendors) are required to acknowledge that they understand and will abide by our policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Moreover, we provide access to our databases containing personally identifiable information on a need-to-know basis only.
%br
%p
  Our security systems are therefore structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing information you provide to us. We also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.  Please understand, though, that this information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided by or submitted to Hoodiny.  Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.
%br
%h3

%p
  If we detect, despite the safeguards set out above, an intrusion or other unauthorized access to or use of personally identifiable information (an 'Intrusion'), we will (i) notify effected users of the Intrusion if the information at issue is sensitive, in our discretion, (ii) deliver this notice by the means we deem most efficient under the circumstances (such as, for example, first class mail or email); (iii) use contact information for each effected user that is current in our files; and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish these steps and effect this notice in a timely manner. To the extent applicable law requires steps in addition to those specified above, we will under all circumstances comply with applicable law.
%br
%h3
  13.	Notification of Changes
%br

If we make any changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, we will attempt to contact you prior to the date the modified policy is scheduled to take effect. We will post notice of the new Policy from the privacy link on our Website. With respect to Site Visitors, your use of our Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed. With respect to Members and Contributing Artists, no such changes will take effect unless and until you have provided us with your consent to such changes, in accordance with Sections 1.2 or Section 1.3, above.

# Feature: Set assumed user's locale when they register
#   So that the website can be rendered in the proper locale for a user
#   As a user
#   I want my locale set automatically when I register
# 
#   Scenario: User gets set an entry point based on... entry point
#     Given the current site is "Cyloop"
#     And I have advanced to step 3 of user registration
#     And I log in with the account I just registered with
#     Then my entry point should be "Cyloop"

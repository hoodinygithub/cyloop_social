Feature: Step 1 - Negative CAPTCHA
  In order to hinder bots from signing up
  As an admin
  I want a negative captcha on the user registration page

  # Scenario: bot fills out field
  #   Given a filled out user registration form
  #   When I fill in "Don't fill in this field" with "OK"
  #   And I press "Send"
  #   Then I should see "Negative captcha must be blank"
